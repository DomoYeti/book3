  <h1 id="hackathon-business-locations">Hackathon - Business Locations</h1>
<p>You are approached by a business developer to get advice on where to build a
new store in Phoenix, AZ. There are currently six candidates. Use the Yelp
dataset and come up with your own scoring scheme to identify the best location
to recommend.</p>
<h2 id="report">Report</h2>
<p><a href="report.html">Read the Report</a></p>
<h2 id="business-types">Business Types</h2>
<p>As a team, choose one of the following business types to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new full-service daycare center</li>
<li>A new full-service car wash</li>
<li>A new 24-hours gym</li>
<li>A new 24-hours diner</li>
<li>A new swimming pool</li>
<li>A new organic food store</li>
<li>A new sushi buffet</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scoring-method">Scoring Method</h2>
<p>For this hackathon, you will use a scoring method that is based on a series of
20 Yes/No questions that can be applied to each candidate location. The candidate
location that has the most number of Yes’s is the most viable location.</p>
<p>Each Yes/No question generally should take on the form of</p>
<p>  <em>Does the location have X nearby?</em></p>
<p>where X is a feature that you think would be useful for the business to be viable.</p>
<p>Two examples of such questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the location have <em>at least one McDonald’s within one mile</em>?</li>
<li>Does the location have <em>at least ten businesses with 100 or more reviews within one mile</em>?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="coding">Coding</h2>
<p>Implement scoring functions and visualize how these candidate locations are
scored. The skeleton code is provided for you in <a href="report.html">report.html</a>.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Each person must implement at least two questions to receive credits for this
hackathon.</p>
